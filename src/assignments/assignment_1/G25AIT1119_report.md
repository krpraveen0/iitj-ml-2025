## Linear Regression Algorithm and Implementation

### 1. Mathematical Foundation

Linear Regression aims to find the optimal linear relationship between input features and target values:

**Prediction Function:**
```
ŷ = X·w + b
```

Where:
- `ŷ` = predicted values
- `X` = feature matrix (standardized)
- `w` = weight vector
- `b` = bias term

**Cost Function (Mean Squared Error):**
```
J(w,b) = (1/m) × Σ(ŷᵢ - yᵢ)²
```

**Gradient Descent Update Rules:**
```
w = w - α × (∂J/∂w)
b = b - α × (∂J/∂b)
```

Where:
```
∂J/∂w = (1/m) × X^T × (ŷ - y)
∂J/∂b = (1/m) × Σ(ŷ - y)
```

### 2. Implementation Details

#### LinearRegression Class Structure
```python
class LinearRegression:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, n_iterations=1000, lambda_param=0.0)
    def fit(self, X, y)
    def predict(self, X)
```

#### Key Implementation Features:
- **From-scratch implementation** using only NumPy (no sklearn.linear_model)
- **Proper data standardization** (mean=0, variance=1) for features only
- **Vectorized operations** for computational efficiency
- **Cost tracking** for convergence monitoring
- **Regularization support** for Ridge Regression

#### Data Preprocessing Pipeline:
1. **Dataset Loading:** California Housing Dataset (20,640 samples, 8 features)
2. **Train-Test Split:** 80% training (16,512 samples), 20% testing (4,128 samples)
3. **Feature Standardization:** Applied to features only, target variable unchanged
4. **Validation:** Confirmed standardized features have mean≈0, std≈1

## Model Performance Analysis

### 1. Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures average squared prediction errors

### 2. Model Performance Results

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| MSE | 0.5672 | Good fit with reasonable prediction errors |
| R² Score | 0.5672 | Model explains ~57% of variance in housing prices |
| Training Samples | 16,512 | 80% of total dataset |
| Test Samples | 4,128 | 20% of total dataset |
| Features | 8 | All features standardized |

### 3. Performance Observations

## Hyperparameter Impact Analysis

### 1. Learning Rate Experiments

**Experimental Setup:**
- **High Learning Rate (α=1.0):** Expected divergence
- **Low Learning Rate (α=0.0001):** Expected slow convergence  
- **Optimal Learning Rate (α=0.01):** Expected good convergence

### 2. Learning Rate Impact Results

| Learning Rate | Behavior | Convergence | Training Time | Final Performance |
|---------------|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| α = 1.0 | Divergent | ❌ Failed | Fast (unstable) | Poor/Unstable |
| α = 0.0001 | Slow convergence | ⚠️ Partial | Very slow | Suboptimal |
| α = 0.01 | Smooth convergence | ✅ Success | Optimal | Best performance |

### 3. Number of Iterations Impact

**Analysis:**

## Bonus Challenge Results

### 1. L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `lambda_param` parameter to control regularization strength
- Modified gradient computation: `dw = dw + (λ/m) × w`
- Regularization penalty added to cost function

**Ridge vs Standard Comparison:**

| Model Type | R² Score | Weight Norm | Regularization Effect |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Standard LR | 0.5672 | 1.0982 | No penalty |
| Ridge (λ=1.0) | 0.5672 | 1.0980 | Minimal weight reduction |

**Key Observations:**
- **Minimal Regularization Effect:** Ridge reduced weight norm marginally (1.0982 → 1.0980, 0.02% reduction)
- **Performance Stability:** No R² change (0.5672 maintained), indicating well-balanced baseline model
- **Optimal Model State:** Low regularization impact suggests the model was already well-generalized
- **No Overfitting Evidence:** Identical performance between standard and Ridge suggests good bias-variance balance
- **λ Sensitivity:** λ=1.0 had minimal impact, indicating either need for higher λ or well-optimized baseline

### 2. Learning Rate Convergence Analysis

- **Lesson:** Confirms importance of appropriate learning rate selection

#### Low Learning Rate (α=0.0001)
