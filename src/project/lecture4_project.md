## Project Idea 1: POS Tagging with HMM
- Implement a Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech tagging.
- Evaluate accuracy on a sample corpus.

## Project Idea 2: Sequence Labeling with CRF
- Use a CRF for named entity recognition (NER) or similar task.
- Compare with HMM results.

## Project Idea 3: MaxEnt for Text Classification
- Build a Maximum Entropy classifier for text data.
- Analyze feature weights and model performance.

## Deliverables
