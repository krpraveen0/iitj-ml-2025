# Project: Lecture 3 â€“ Ensemble Methods

---

## Project Idea 1: Random Forest Classifier
- Build a Random Forest on a public dataset (e.g., Titanic, MNIST).
- Analyze feature importance and model accuracy.

## Project Idea 2: Boosting for Classification
- Implement AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting on a dataset.
- Compare results with a single decision tree.

## Project Idea 3: Stacking Models
- Combine multiple classifiers (e.g., SVM, kNN, Decision Tree) using stacking.
- Evaluate ensemble vs. individual models.

## Deliverables
- Code, report, and visualizations.
