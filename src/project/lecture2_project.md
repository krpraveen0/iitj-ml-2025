# Project: Lecture 2 â€“ Bayesian & Decision Tree Applications

---

## Project Idea 1: Email Spam Classifier
- Build a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam emails using a public dataset.
- Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project Idea 2: Medical Diagnosis with Decision Trees
- Use a decision tree to classify patients based on symptoms (e.g., diabetes, heart disease dataset).
- Visualize the tree and interpret the rules.

## Project Idea 3: Compare Naive Bayes and Decision Tree
- Implement both algorithms on the same dataset.
- Compare their performance and discuss strengths/weaknesses.

## Deliverables
- Code (Python/Jupyter Notebook)
- Report (methodology, results, discussion)
- Visualizations (tree diagrams, confusion matrix, etc.)
